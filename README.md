# ColorChroma

**ColorChroma** is an iOS application designed to assist users — particularly those with color vision deficiencies — in identifying, understanding, and interacting with colors in their environment.

The app leverages **real-time computer vision** and **Google’s Gemini AI** to provide a suite of tools for color analysis and practical assistance.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is currently under development and is **not intended for public use**.

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Color Identification

* **Instant Analysis:** Point your camera at any object to get its descriptive color name (e.g., *“Vivid Blue”*, *“Dark Dull Green”*) and hex code instantly.
* **Precise Aiming:** A central reticle on the camera screen ensures accurate targeting.
* **AI Descriptions:** Tap the color info panel for an AI-generated description that compares the color to familiar objects and evokes associated feelings.

### 2. AI-Powered Assistants

* **Clothing Matcher:** Upload photos of two clothing items. The AI stylist provides a verdict (e.g., “✅ Excellent Match”) with reasoning based on color theory and contrast.
* **Color Comparison:** Compare the prominent colors of any two objects and get a detailed explanation of their similarities and differences.
* **Reference Comparison:** Match a live object’s color against a reference image (great for tasks like paint matching or food doneness checks).
* **Sorting Assistant:** Automatically groups items into broad color categories (e.g., *“Reds & Pinks”*, *“Blues & Purples”*) — ideal for sorting laundry.
* **Chart & Map Analyzer:** Upload an image of a chart, graph, or map. The AI interprets it, describing data, trends, and legends in an accessible format.
* **Food & Cooking Aid:** Get visual-based AI assistance for checking the ripeness of produce or the doneness of cooked foods.
* **Indicator Scanner:** Identifies the color and probable meaning of status lights on electronic devices.

### 3. Interactive & Learning Tools

* **Chroma AI Chat:** Converse with *Chroma*, a color-specialized AI assistant. Ask about color differences, matches, or theory.
* **Item Labeling & Saving:** Capture and label items, saving their colors to a personal library with **SwiftData**.
* **Color Perception Test:** An interactive, Ishihara-style color vision test *(for exploration, not diagnosis).*
* **Color Reference:** A searchable library of standard color swatches and hex codes.
* **Information Hub:** Learn about various types of color vision deficiencies and accessibility topics.

## Configuration

To build and run **ColorChroma**, you’ll need your own **Google Gemini API key**:

1. Navigate to:

   ```
   ColorChroma/Resources/
   ```
2. Open the file:

   ```
   GenerativeAI-Info.plist
   ```
3. Insert your key as the string value for:

   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY
   ```

> ⚠️ The app will **crash on launch** if a valid API key is not provided.
